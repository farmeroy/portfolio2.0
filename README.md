This is the second iteration of my portfolio site, thie time built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Material UI](https://mui.com)

I really enjoyed learning how to use MUI to create a clean layout.
My theme is based on [cocopan's](https://github.com/cocopon) theme for Vim, [Iceberg](https://cocopon.github.io/iceberg.vim/). 

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/farmeroy/portfolio2.0.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
